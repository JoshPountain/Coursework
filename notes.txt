Find where frame angles are generated
seems to be in validate point 
frame is not globally generated, instaed each object in render is checked if it is in frame.
May be more efficient to store the angles the object is from the cam angles in the class and have objects that are within the 'seen' angles show on screen.
Are we doing this properly, or just simulating having it all seen?
Draw some axis in like adnaz had to test?
How to draw objects?

to do:
-What does validate points do?(Maybe check if seeing?)
-What does getPerspective do?
-Make draw object do something(can be simple circle for planets, take an id of some kind, colour differentiation for now)
-Make create Framework

Assuming set rotation working

Testing
-rotate
-detDist
-GetDirection
