checkdebug function in camera class is only thing to uotput ot console now.
create frame seems to be disfunctional
using watch 2 to fix getPerspective

Test 1 : testing getdirection
{
plan : 
-Get use set rotation to find a point. 
-Save the angle it should be and the point. 
-Set rotation back to [0, 0]. 
-Use get direction with saved point
-Compare

result:
-Found flaw in detdirectionwhen rotation set as (180, 90)
-Only problem with first val?
-

}


SetRotation:
Gets the coordinates you would be looking at based on rotation. 2 values taken, based on you being the centre of a sphere, tahing the degrees around you are (Atheta)
and the elevation / how high/low you are looking, then sets the 'rotation' to be the input values and the 'facing' values to be tyhe found coordinates.

GetDirection:
Works as a sort of reverse to Set rotation, gets point and finds the angle away from [0, 0] rotation.


getPerspective:
Small innaccuracies around multiples of 90 because of not handling 0's as input with trig functions.
******not making the first angle right********
